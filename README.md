# SE/CprE 416 – Assignment 3

This repository contains the solutions for Assignment 3 in SE/CprE 416. The assignment consists of four main problems, each addressing different software quality aspects, including string permutation generation, enhancement of an object‑oriented system, optimization of sensor data processing, and a comprehensive code review/refactoring of the Apache POI XSSFWorkbook class.

## Assignment Overview

- **Problem 1 – Permutations of a String:**  
  Develop a program in your language of choice to generate and print all permutations of a given input string using an iterative approach (and then a recursive approach). High-quality coding practices, including clear naming, modularity, documentation, and error handling, are emphasized.

- **Problem 2 – Enhancing an Object-Oriented System:**  
  Refine a previously developed toy-sized object-oriented system (featuring classes such as *Instrument*, *Guitar*, *Piano*, and *MusicPlayer*) by applying software quality and optimization techniques.

- **Problem 3 – Sensor Data Processing Optimization:**  
  Analyze and improve the efficiency of a poorly written `SensorDataProcessor` class by suggesting optimization strategies and providing a “code jammed” version of the critical code segment.

- **Problem 4 – Code Review of Apache POI XSSFWorkbook:**  
  Refactored the `cloneSheet` function in the XSSFWorkbook class. The new version splits the large method into smaller, focused helper functions with improved readability, low coupling, and robust error handling.
